Matteo Niccoli was created a geologist at the University of Rome, Italy, but then went rogue after a successfull gravity and magnetics campaign in the Soutern Tuscany mineral district and decided to become a Geophysicist. He started (and completed) a MAsters degree at the University of Calgary and has now been working for 12 in the E&P business, mostly in Calgary, Alberta, but with a stint in Stavanger, Norway.  He is a registered Geophysicist with APEGA, the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta, and is currently happily employed by Birchcliff Energy as a Senior Geophysicist. He is an independent enterpreneur with MyCarta and Geoscience blogger / researcher. He is @my_carta on Twitter.
