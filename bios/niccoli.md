Matteo Niccoli was created a geologist at the University of Rome, Italy, but then went rogue after a successfull gravity and magnetics campaign in the Soutern Tuscany mineral district and decided to become a Geophysicist. As part of the self-reprogramming he started (and completed) a Masters degree at the University of Calgary and has now been working for 12 in the E&P business, mostly in Calgary, Alberta, but with a stint in Stavanger, Norway. He is a registered Geophysicist with APEGA, the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta, and is currently happily employed by Birchcliff Energy. He is an independent enterpreneur with MyCarta and Geoscience blogger / researcher. He is @my_carta on Twitter.
