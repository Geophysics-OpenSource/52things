Justin works as a software engineer for Valador Inc. and is contracted onto a technology & innovation team that works to infuse modern data analytics into the non-science and non-engineering parts of NASA though consulting and small prototypes. He also has ten years experience as an oil and gas geologist and still makes geology jokes even though no one one his current team understands them. His work products focus on data visualization and data analytics applications, and his side products range from d3.js data visualizations of Game of Thrones battles to web-controlled talking pumpkins for Halloween.
