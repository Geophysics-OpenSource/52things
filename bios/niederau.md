Jan is a PhD Student at the Institute for Applied Geophysics and Geothermal Institute at the RWTH-Aachen University, Germany. His research topic focuses on geothermal reservoir simulation, and how to assess (and quantify) uncertainties of those _exploration models_. During his work as a Phd Student, he self-taught how to code, and learned multiple languages (to different degree of proficiency). 
His weapon of choice is Python, but Fortran, R, and Julia are also not alien to him.
Next to his research, teaching is Jan's passion during his days at the University. He's taught many courses on geothermics, geophysics, and to some extent petrology.
During his teaching sessions, he was often confronted with geo-students, who saw Matlab, or an IDE, for the first time. So he started teaching geo-students to code.
