Justin works as a software engineer for Valador Inc. and is contracted onto a technology & innovation team that works to infuse modern data analytics into the non-science and non-engineering parts of NASA though consulting and small prototypes. He also has ten years experience as an oil and gas geologist. He still makes geology jokes even if no one in his current office understands them. Justin writes mostly in JavaScript and Python with R, PHP, and other languages sneaking in when required. His work products focus on data visualization and data analytics applications, and his side products range from d3.js data visualizations of Game of Thrones battles to talking web-controlled pumpkins for Halloween.
