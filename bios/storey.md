Martin Storeyâ€™s serendipitous life has brought him experience in well data acquisition in the field, data exploitation in the office, and data management in basement, attics, and dark corners of company networks around the world. He grew up in France, obtained a BSc (Math. & Comp. Science, 1985) from Stanford University and an MSc (Electrical Engineering, 1987) from the California Institute of Technology.  After working internationally for an oil services company as a logging engineer and for a super major as a petrophysicist, he became an independent consultant and trainer in 1998 and founded Well Data QA in 2012.  He is an advocate for data quality and good practices also through his active membership of SPE, SPWLA, and PPDM.
