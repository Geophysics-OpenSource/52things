John is a research geoscientist that has been working in the oil industry since he was 19 years old.  He holds a B.Sc. *summa cum laude* and a Ph.D. in the Geosciences from the University of Texas at Dallas.  He pioneered the use of 3D outcrop capture techniques before going on to work in various roles in production and exploration, ultimately ending up as an exploration manager before realizing that the further you go up the chain, the less fun you can have by working with real problems.  He has too many hobbies to rationally keep up with, including 3D printing, antenna design, and developing absurd gadgetry, but that doesn't stop him from finding new ones on a regular basis.
