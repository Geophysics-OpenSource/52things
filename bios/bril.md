Bert Bril is a geophysicist by training, but a software developer by heart. He uses most languages with a capital ‘C’ in it, but he isn’t afraid of many other languages. He is co-founder of dGB Earth Sciences, where he was one of the initiators of OpendTect. In the OpendTect team he is mainly involved in getting basic architecture and design in shape, but still does a lot of coding each day. He likes to work truly agile, and believes that methodologies like scrum are usually not helping to get that right. Against his will he is also being deployed as the specialist in the SEG-Y format - this mainly because no one else in the OpendTect team wants to get near the subject. As a survivor of lots of surgery on his heart valves he doesn’t care about a lot of things that most people do. One of his long-term goals is to get better at staying away from rants and flames.
