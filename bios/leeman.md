John is a geoscientific consultant, designing and producing custom hardware and
software.  He received a B.S. in meteorology, a B.S. in geophysics, and a minor
in mathematics from the University of Oklahoma in 2012 and a PhD in geoscience
from Penn State in 2017. John has worked in a variety of fields from gas
hydrates to aerospace to earthquake physics, but the common thread has always
been developing novel hardware and software to tackle a problem. He believes
that by adopting a set of best practices and applying as much rigor to our
instruments as we do to our science, we can push the boundaries of research
further, faster.
