_52 Things You Should Know About Geocomputing_

This is a second attempt at collecting 52 essays about geocomputing. [Here's the original call for papers](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2014/12/29/geocomputing-call-for-papers), from a little over 2 years ago. This time we can do it!

**Authors**, please see [Submitting an essay](Submitting_an_essay.md).

**Reviewers**, please see [Reviewing submissions](Reviewing_submissions.md).

## Wish list

If you have a topic you wish someone would write about, please add it here:

- Three ways to get started in geocomputing.
- Drop everything and learn X (Julia? Clojure?).
- Getting started in HPC in 3 easy steps.
- Only a quantum computer can do geology.
- Geocomputing at enterprise scale.
- Open sourcing a corporate software project.
- Data standards, lol.
- Geocomputing in the year 2028.
- Teaching geoscientists to code: Everything Drew Steen said is wrong
- Thank you for the state-of-the-art processing, I will now proceed to interpret it incorrectly.
- Units -sigh- let's start using pint (like metpy), astropy, or _something_.
- How tech ubiquity is changing geoscientific observation.
- 5 libraries for geophysicists: obspy, madagascar, simpeg, vispy, etc.
- 5 libraries for geologists: pynoddy, qgis, pygmt, pandas/welly/striplog, etc.
- 5 libraries for geobiologists: dplyr, magrittr (maybe), tidyr, vegan, ggplot2
