## Wish list

If you have a topic you wish someone would write about, please add it here:

- Drop everything and learn X (Julia? Clojure?).
- Only a quantum computer can do geology.
- Data standards, lol.
- Geocomputing in the year 2028.
- Thank you for the state-of-the-art processing, I will now proceed to interpret it incorrectly.
- Units -sigh- let's start using pint (like metpy), astropy, or _something_.
- How tech ubiquity is changing geoscientific observation.
