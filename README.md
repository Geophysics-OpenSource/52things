52 Things You Should Know About Geocomputing

This is a second attempt at collecting 52 essays about geocomputing. [Here's the original call for papers](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2014/12/29/geocomputing-call-for-papers), from a little over 2 years ago. This time we can do it!

To make a submission: 

- Fork this repo and add your chapter, preferably in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Look at some existing chapters to see the style and follow it as closely as you can.
- If you prefer, [email it to me](mailto:matt@agilescientific.com).
- Add your bio to `bios`, your B&W hi-res headshot to `headshots`, and any figures to `figures` like `figures/yourname_fig1.png`.
- Mark code in your chapter by indenting with 4 spaces.
- Add a row to the table below.

To review:

- Leave your name in the table below.
- Add an issue, tagging the author and giving the title, and list your remarks about the manuscript in the issue body. Add one issue per manuscript you review.
