        - You Should Learn to Write JavaScript Because It Is Hard to Kill
    - Content
        - Introduction to JavaScript & Early History & introduction to main point
            - Why this article = I went to PyCon and it was obvious people there really didn't like JavaScript and were plotting how to avoid and or kill it
            - It was written in a very short time
            - It misbehaves and does enough weird things that people can make highly watched talks and podcasts whose whole points is just to laugh at JS
            - It is easy to make the argument that other languages are better
            - But... because browser, and then later mindshare.. it is very, very hard to kill
        - Attempted Murders
            - JavaApplets & plugins
            - JavaScript is locked in more than Microsoft, but maybe it too can lose control?
            - Asm.js
            - WebAssembly
        - JavaScript Growth
            - Node.js mindshare example
            - Computing moves to phones, to cloud, to browser. Browsers are getting very powerful. 
            - Graphics and processing always catch up. 
            - Browsers have huge institutional levels of backing
        - Abscomb's Principle
            - Abscombs principle: any piece of code will eventually be re-written into JavaScript, even if for no good reason.
                - Apollo guidance system as example
            - Browswer still matters even if indirectly... because...
              - Certain things faster now due to GPU
            - Basically
                - 1. browser has JS locked in
                  2. mind-share
                  3. GPU
        - Take away / What You Can Do With JS- 
                - You should learn a bit as it is what you'll use to put things on a screen if you want it to be widely used in the future.
                - more things moving to web
                - phones are more capable
                    - Graphics
                    - Processing power
                    - AR/VR
                    - Not everyhing has to live under your desk in a tower to be a useful computer these days.
                - web can be desktop (steal Java's tag-line and develop once run anyway)
                - Altair & Jupyter notebooks announcement.
                    - It isn't all bad... maybe more of a passing back and forth and less of a fence to throw things over?
        - Summary: What controls these things? 
                - It isn't just Engineering also anthropology, economics, behavioral economocs, and timing!
                - Worthwhile to learn JavaScript because it isn't going anywhere and it is how you get things on something other people will see
