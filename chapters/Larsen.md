Hi, I am Eirik, 44 years old, 183 cm tall, Norwegian, a sedimentologist, a sequence stratigrapher, a geologist, a geoscientist, an explorationist. There are plenty of labels and metrics to describe me, you, and also the rocks we all love to explore. Geology as a science has a rich vocabulary and abundant measurement and classification schemes for describing rocks and all sorts of features of the planet Earth. As an explorationist I have contributed to some discoveries, but also to lots of dry and disappointing wells. Exploration for oil and gas is hard. Fancy academic degrees and years of studying, mainly describing, rocks is not necessarily enough to satisfy the expectations of those who pay for our advice and use it to as the basis for their ginormous investments in exploration wells and campaigns. As explorationists we are basically investment advisors, highly educated ones, expected to provide profitable advice to our employees or clients. Often we are under pressure to deliver quick analysis in time for various deadlines, but on rare occasions we are given the opportunity to give it all we've got.

A few years back I was given such an opportunity. A manager asked me to estimate the reservoir quality of a handful of prospects in one of his company's blocks. Not an uncommon request from an exploration manager to a sedimentary geologist. However, this project was special. There was no rush. The schedule allowed for a whole year of data analysis. Plenty of data and resources were available to. Dedicated petrophysicists and petrographers, rock physics experts, you name it. Obviously I figured this time I'd better deliver some truly awesome analysis.

What is reservoir quality? Investors in exploration drilling obviously want to know what to expect in return from their investment, and what the chances are that they'll see any return at all. Reservoir quality prediction is just one piece of the "equation" we as explorationists are expected to solve in order to provide sound investment advice. It's an important piece though. It relates to how large a volume of hydrocarbons we can expect to find, and how much we can expect to extract once a potential oil or gas field is developed. Porosity and permeability are key metrics in order to describe, or in this case predict, reservoir quality. A problem for those of us who explore is that we can only apply our skills at describing rocks in places where they are sampled, i.e cored, or at least measured with some reliable logging tools. Of course that data is never available in the areas that we're expected to to provide answers for, i.e. the prospects. Our skills at describing rocks don't suffice. We need to predict. Yes, we do have seismic, and colleagues well versed in rock physics and seismic QI. Sometimes, as in my case example prospects are deep, seismic resolution is low and signal to noise ratios likewise and as a result there are limits to what our geophysicist friends can do. Ok, there are well known geological trends; reservoir quality deteriorates with depth, reservoir quality is related to depositional environments and sedimentary facies, to burial history, to temperature and pressure. In short, reservoir quality is a function of a lot of other properties. Reservoir quality prediction, like so many other tasks in predictive geology, is a multidimensional problem and a non-linear one to. Armed with some basic math skills and the omnipresent Excel, I got to work on the problem hoping to deliver the awesomest reservoir quality study ever. Cross plots were produced; porosity vs. depth, porosity vs. temperature, porosity vs. pressure, porosity vs. sedimentary facies. Whatever data was available was cross plotted agains "reservoir quality". There were so many cross plots I decided to print them, spread them across the boardroom table in an attempt to glean some insight from it all. Information overdose. There was simply to much to absorb. Attempts were made to visualise the multidimensional nature of the problem by colour and symbol coding the data points in the otherwise two dimensional coordinate systems. Still to much information to absorb, and definitely to much to represent by some mathematical function. Or perhaps not? What would I know. Mathematicians and statisticians must have dealt with similar problems before? And so my journey began in the exploration of techniques for multidimensional and non-linear regression and classification. As is commonly the case when you dig deep into some subject you discover interesting things; Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence. Technology I had thought were way beyond what a humble geologist might ever learn to exploit. It is not! Thanks to a vast community of coders and developers there is a rich ecosystem of tools available to tackle multidimensional, non linear regression and classification problems. These tools are available as code libraries to accessible programming languages such as Python. Even better, lots of tools are available free of charge; open source. In fact some of the best coders in the most high tech companies on the planet are offering their Machine Learning/AI tools as open source. This is a fantastic opportunity for those of us who make geological predictions for a living. Covering the boardroom table with cross plots will not bring you to subsurface-insight nirvana. Instead learn to exploit the tools that are now available. This rabbit hole is deep and getting deeper. Go explore it, be creative and try out AI-assisted methods for your complex prediction problems. 

Be aware, there are snakes down there, pythons, anacondas, and spyders to. They may bite unsuspecting geologists venturing into their domain. Go for it anyway. Get involved with the growing community of geoscientists that are exploring and exploiting AI technology. If you can take the pain it WILL make you stronger. In fact it might give you predictive superpowers beyond what you could imagine.
