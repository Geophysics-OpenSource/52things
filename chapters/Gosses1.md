The phrase “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” was written by Isaac Newton to Robert Hooke in reference to building upon the work his predecessors. In science, we often think of these giants as long dead men in history books. In computer science, many of the giants are still alive. In open-source, they are people you meet at conferences. In inner source, they are your co-workers writing code right now, including those you’ve never met. 
 
If there is a low hanging fruit of innovation, it might be inner source. While open-source has proved its value in terms of better code through more eyeballs and the ability to leverage mindshare to organize development of code ecosystems without centralized control, open-source is hard for companies, and especially hard for oil and gas. Lawyers get involved. Release processes are slow, non-existent, or written for the worst-case scenario. inner source offers many of the benefits with increased speed and less institutional pushback. It is also a stepping stone to open-source, though you might want to keep that to yourself initially.
 
Inner source refers to the sharing and reuse of code written in an organization by any other part of the organization. While oil and gas companies are adept at sharing within disciplines geographically distributed in multiple offices, up and down the chain of command hand-off style, or across disciplines operating in a local area, inner source needs to be code sharing across the entire company. Financial analysts and geoscientists both use Pandas, a data analysis library. Petrophysicists and procurements can both use natural language processing for their respective documents. Engineers building monitoring software for offshore installments and in-store marketing analysts might both be using OpenCV for image recognition. Traditional boundaries in oil and gas aren't helpful when it comes to sharing code. The distinguishing characteristics are tools and techniques, not discipline, geography, data source, or upstream versus downstream. 
 
If people writing similar code, using similar tools, or solving similar problems can be exposed to each other, there are opportunities for learning, mentorship, code reuse, and inspiration that only happen in an organization that enables both code sharing and discovery of similar code, skills, and programmers in another part of the organization. 
 
Technologically, the “how” for getting started inner source is simple. As github has become the default place for open-source development, enterprise github and gitlab instances running on internal enterprise servers make up most of the inner source space. The technological means of code and programmer discovery has less of an established answer, but it it likely natural language processing, recommendation engines using machine-learning based clustering, and already known patterns of discipline development can be merged. 
 
The cultural aspects of instra-source are more challenging.

Best practice
  - Will be questioned more and more by young people who know how to code and judged by older people who don’t
  - Best practice in code is less on methods and more about clarity, style, and success of end product.
 
More people have skills.
  - how to distribute those people
  - organizational model impact
  - How will this change over time as more people know how to code?
  - How to deal with some people having skills but not others
 
Code running inside programs, outside, separate, webpages ~ risk of technical debt?
 
The dreaded black box! 
  - "no one should believe any of it if it can't be broken down into a simple list of variables and an equation and explained to a manager."
  - Black box from not having access to internals
  - Black box from not understanding
  - Black box from changing models as new data and methods are added continuously
