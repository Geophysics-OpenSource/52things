The phrase “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” was written by Isaac Newton to Robert Hooke in reference to building on the work his predecessors. In science, we often think of these giants as long dead men in history books. In computer science, many of the giants are still alive.  In open-source, they are middle aged to young people you end up drinking beer with at conferences. In intra-source, they are your co-workers writing code right now, including those you’ve never met. 
 
If there is a low hanging fruit of innovation, it might be intra-source. While open-source has proved its value in terms of better code through more eyeballs and the ability to leverage mindshare to organize development of code ecosystems without centralized control, open-source is hard for companies, and especially hard for oil and gas. Lawyers get involved. Release processes are slow, non-existent, or written for the worst-case scenario. Intra-source offers many of the benefits with increased speed and less institutional pushback. 
 
Intra-source refers to the sharing and reuse of code written in an organization by any other part of the organization. While oil and gas companies are adept at sharing within disciplines geographically distributed in multiple offices, up and down the chain of command hand-off style, or across disciplines operating in a local area, intra-source needs to be code sharing across the entire company. Financial analysts and geoscientists both use Pandas, a data analysis library. Petrophysicists and procurements both had an interest in natural language processing. Engineers building monitoring software for offshore installments and in-store marketing analysts might be both using OpenCV for image recognition. Traditional boundaries in oil and gas aren't helpful when it comes to sharing code. The distinguishing characteristics are tools, not disciplines or position with the exploration to marketing stream. 
 
If people writing similar code, using similar tools, or solving similar problems can be exposed to each other, there are opportunities for learning, mentorship, code reuse, and inspiration that only happen in an organization that enables both code sharing and code/skill/programmer discovery. 
 
Technologically, the “how” for getting started intra-source is simple. As github has is the default place for open-source development, enterprise github and gitlab instances running on internal enterprise servers dominate the intra-source space. The cultural aspects of instra-source are more challenging. 
 
 
continuing.... 
 
Best practice
  - Will be questioned more and more by young people who know how to code and judged by older people who don’t
  - Best practice in code is less on methods and more about clarity, style, and success of end product.

More people have skills.
  - how to distribute those people
  - organizational model impact
  - How will this change over time as more people know how to code?
  - How to deal with some people having skills but not others

Code running inside programs, outside, separate, webpages ~ risk of technical debt?

The dreaded black box! 
  - "no one should believe any of it if it can't be broken down into a simple list of variables and an equation and explained to a manager."
  - Black box from not having access to internals
  - Black box from not understanding
  - Black box from changing models as new data and methods are added continuously
